The [Green Unicorn](http://gunicorn.org/) is a Python WSGI HTTP Server for
UNIX. It uses a pre-fork worker model ported from Ruby's Unicorn project. The
Gunicorn server is broadly compatible with various web frameworks, simply
implemented, light on server resources, and fairly speedy.

The `debops.gunicorn` Ansible role uses the [Debian package configuration structure](https://chris-lamb.co.uk/posts/sysadmin-friendly-deployment-gunicorn-debian)
to manage multiple `gunicorn` applications as a signle service. This can be
used to deploy applications that use either a system Python installation, or
a `virtualenv` Python environment.

### Installation

This role requires at least Ansible `v2.0.0`. To install it, run:

```Shell
ansible-galaxy install debops.gunicorn
```

### Documentation

More information about `debops.gunicorn` can be found in the
[official debops.gunicorn documentation](https://docs.debops.org/en/latest/ansible/roles/ansible-gunicorn/docs/).



### Are you using this as a standalone role without DebOps?

You may need to include missing roles from the [DebOps common
playbook](https://github.com/debops/debops-playbooks/blob/master/playbooks/common.yml)
into your playbook.
